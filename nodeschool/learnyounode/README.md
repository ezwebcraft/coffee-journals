# LEARN YOU THE NODE.JS FOR MUCH WIN!  

## HELLO WORLD (Exercise 1 of 13)  

Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console  
(stdout).  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

## HINTS  

To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and  
start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the node  
command. e.g.:  

  `$ node program.js`  

You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:  

  `console.log("text")`

When you are done, you must run:  

  `$ learnyounode verify program.js`  

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and  
the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.  


## BABY STEPS (Exercise 2 of 13)  

 Write a program that accepts one or more numbers as command-line arguments  
 and prints the sum of those numbers to the console (stdout).  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

## HINTS  

 You can access command-line arguments via the global process object. The  
 process object has an argv property which is an array containing the  
 complete command-line. i.e. process.argv.  

 To get started, write a program that simply contains:  

    `console.log(process.argv)`

 Run it with node program.js and some numbers as arguments. e.g:  

    `$ node program.js 1 2 3 `

 In which case the output would be an array looking something like:  

    `[ 'node', '/path/to/your/program.js', '1', '2', '3' ]`  

 You'll need to think about how to loop through the number arguments so  
 you can output just their sum. The first element of the process.argv array  
 is always 'node', and the second element is always the path to your  
 program.js file, so you need to start at the 3rd element (index 2), adding  
 each item to the total until you reach the end of the array.  

 Also be aware that all elements of process.argv are strings and you may  
 need to coerce them into numbers. You can do this by prefixing the  
 property with + or passing it to Number(). e.g. +process.argv[2] or  
 Number(process.argv[2]).  

 learnyounode will be supplying arguments to your program when you run  
 learnyounode verify program.js so you don't need to supply them yourself.  
 To test your program without verifying it, you can invoke it with  
 learnyounode run program.js. When you use run, you are invoking the test  
 environment that learnyounode sets up for each exercise.  


## MY FIRST I/O! (Exercise 3 of 13)  

  Write a program that uses a single synchronous filesystem operation to  
  read a file and print the number of newlines (\n) it contains to the  
  console (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.  

  The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first  
  command-line argument (i.e., process.argv[2]). You do not need to make  
  your own test file.  

 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

## HINTS  

  To perform a filesystem operation you are going to need the fs module from  
  the Node core library. To load this kind of module, or any other "global"  
  module, use the following incantation:  

     `var fs = require('fs')`  

  Now you have the full fs module available in a variable named fs.  

  All synchronous (or blocking) filesystem methods in the fs module end with  
  'Sync'. To read a file, you'll need to use  
  fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file'). This method will return a Buffer object  
  containing the complete contents of the file.  

  Documentation on the fs module can be found by pointing your browser here:  
  file:///usr/lib64/node_modules/learnyounode/node_apidoc/fs.html  

  Buffer objects are Node's way of efficiently representing arbitrary arrays  
  of data, whether it be ascii, binary or some other format. Buffer objects  
  can be converted to strings by simply calling the toString() method on  
  them. e.g. var str = buf.toString().  

  Documentation on Buffers can be found by pointing your browser here:  
  file:///usr/lib64/node_modules/learnyounode/node_apidoc/buffer.html  

  If you're looking for an easy way to count the number of newlines in a  
  string, recall that a JavaScript String can be .split() into an array of  
  substrings and that '\n' can be used as a delimiter. Note that the test  
  file does not have a newline character ('\n') at the end of the last line,  
  so using this method you'll end up with an array that has one more element  
  than the number of newlines.

## MY FIRST ASYNC I/O! (Exercise 4 of 13)  

    Write a program that uses a single asynchronous filesystem operation to  
    read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console  
    (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.  

    The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first  
    command-line argument.  

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

# HINTS  

    The solution to this problem is almost the same as the previous problem  
    except you must now do it the Node.js way: asynchronous.  

    Instead of fs.readFileSync() you will want to use fs.readFile() and  
    instead of using the return value of this method you need to collect the  
    value from a callback function that you pass in as the second argument. To  
    learn more about callbacks, check out:  
    (https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#callbacks).  

    Remember that idiomatic Node.js callbacks normally have the signature:  

  `function callback (err, data) { /* ... */ }`  

    so you can check if an error occurred by checking whether the first  
    argument is truthy. If there is no error, you should have your Buffer  
    object as the second argument. As with readFileSync(), you can supply  
    'utf8' as the second argument and put the callback as the third argument  
    and you will get a String instead of a Buffer.  

    Documentation on the fs module can be found by pointing your browser here:  
    file:///usr/lib64/node_modules/learnyounode/node_apidoc/fs.html  


## FILTERED LS (Exercise 5 of 13)  

     Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory,  
     filtered by the extension of the files. You will be provided a directory  
     name as the first argument to your program (e.g. '/path/to/dir/') and a  
     file extension to filter by as the second argument.  

     For example, if you get 'txt' as the second argument then you will need to  
     filter the list to only files that end with .txt. Note that the second  
     argument will not come prefixed with a '.'.  

     Keep in mind that the first arguments of your program are not the first  
     values of the process.argv array, as the first two values are reserved for  
     system info by Node.  

     The list of files should be printed to the console, one file per line. You  
     must use asynchronous I/O.  

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

## HINTS  

     The fs.readdir() method takes a pathname as its first argument and a  
     callback as its second. The callback signature is:  

   `function callback (err, list) { /* ... */ }`

     where list is an array of filename strings.  

     Documentation on the fs module can be found by pointing your browser here:  
     file:///usr/lib64/node_modules/learnyounode/node_apidoc/fs.html  

     You may also find node's path module helpful, particularly the extname  
     method.  

     Documentation on the path module can be found by pointing your browser  
     here: file:///usr/lib64/node_modules/learnyounode/node_apidoc/path.html

# LEARN YOU THE NODE.JS FOR MUCH WIN!  

## MAKE IT MODULAR (Exercise 6 of 13)  

     This problem is the same as the previous but introduces the concept of  
     modules. You will need to create two files to solve this.  

     Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory,  
     filtered by the extension of the files. The first argument is the  
     directory name and the second argument is the extension filter. Print the  
     list of files (one file per line) to the console. You must use  
     asynchronous I/O.  

     You must write a module file to do most of the work. The module must  
     export a single function that takes three arguments: the directory name,  
     the filename extension string and a callback function, in that order. The  
     filename extension argument must be the same as what was passed to your  
     program. Don't turn it into a RegExp or prefix with "." or do anything  
     except pass it to your module where you can do what you need to make your  
     filter work.  

     The callback function must be called using the idiomatic node(err, data)  
     convention. This convention stipulates that unless there's an error, the  
     first argument passed to the callback will be null, and the second will be  
     your data. In this exercise, the data will be your filtered list of files,  
     as an Array. If you receive an error, e.g. from your call to  
     fs.readdir(), the callback must be called with the error, and only the  
     error, as the first argument.  

     You must not print directly to the console from your module file, only  
     from your original program.  

     In the case of an error bubbling up to your original program file, simply  
     check for it and print an informative message to the console.  

     These four things are the contract that your module must follow.  

      1. Export a single function that takes exactly the arguments described.  
      2. Call the callback exactly once with an error or some data as described.  
      3. Don't change anything else, like global variables or stdout.  
      4. Handle all the errors that may occur and pass them to the callback.  

     The benefit of having a contract is that your module can be used by anyone  
     who expects this contract. So your module could be used by anyone else who  
     does learnyounode, or the verifier, and just work.  

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

## HINTS  

     Create a new module by creating a new file that just contains your  
     directory reading and filtering function. To define a single function  
     export, you assign your function to the module.exports object, overwriting  
     what is already there:  

   `module.exports = function (args) { /* ... */ }`  

     Or you can use a named function and assign the name.  

     To use your new module in your original program file, use the require()  
     call in the same way that you require('fs') to load the fs module. The  
     only difference is that for local modules must be prefixed with './'. So,  
     if your file is named mymodule.js then:  

        `var mymodule = require('./mymodule.js')`  

     The '.js' is optional here and you will often see it omitted.  

     You now have the module.exports object in your module assigned to the  
     mymodule variable. Since you are exporting a single function, mymodule is  
     a function you can call!  

     Also keep in mind that it is idiomatic to check for errors and do  
     early-returns within callback functions: ```JavaScript

        function bar (callback) {  
          foo(function (err, data) {  
            if (err)  
              return callback(err) // early return  

            // ... no error, continue doing cool things with `data`  

            // all went well, call callback with `null` for the error argument  

            callback(null, data)  
          })  
        }
        ```
